We take unwanted, abandoned, abused, or stray pets and attempt to find suitable homes for them.Small Paws is founded and run by volunteers who care 

for animals— including training, playing, handling medical issues,and solving behavior problems — until a suitable permanent home can be found. Large 

communities of stray cats can be a nuisance to people. The animals themselves also suffer from a lack of food, untreated wounds and injuries leading to 

infection and sometimes even death, well as countless unwanted kittens born to females that are too weak and malnourished to feed them.We’re not just 

talking about dogs and cats here, though they’re often the target of animal rescue operations. Many other animals need rescuing.
    
Whether a dog is stuck on the 18th floor ledge of a building or a bird is entangled in manja on a 50 feet high coconut tree..

 Whether it is a kitten stuck in a pipe or a puppy trapped under a mountain of rubble.. 

Whether a leopard has fallen down a well or a bull that has fallen in an underground water tank..

<b> they are rescued by Small Paws Rescue Center, a mobile rescue team that goes above and beyond for animals stuck in extreme situations. </b>

        style="float:right;width:320px;height:300px;">
        At Small Paws, we rescue animals that are hurt and injured, and only the homeless or “unowned” ones. Thousands of 
        
        animals live on the streets of Pune including dogs, cats, cows, buffaloes, donkeys, horses, pigs, goats, sheep and 
        
        birds. Sometimes, we also offer help to other legal organisations with respect to rehabilitation of seized animals 
        
        or cruelty cases, and have thus rehabilitated laboratory-rescued beagle dogs in the past few 
        
        years at the SMALL PAWS Centre. Street dogs survive on the road off garbage or leftovers. While some dogs and cats 
        
        live in quiet lanes, it is very common to find main roads and intersections with plenty of street dogs, where they 
        
        forage for food from garbage dumpsters. The street dog population is said to grow directly proportional to the 
        
        increase in urban population and garbage (and the lack of proper disposal for the latter!).

        <h2 style="background-color:rgb(10, 94, 24);color:white;">HOW DO WE OPERATE</h2>

<b>1.AID Alert</b>
    Our team receives information about an animal in distress (AID Alert) either directly from the public community through our organisation Small PAWS
    
    Charitable Trust's helplines or we get called in by governmental bodies like the Forest Department, Animal Husbandry, Fire Department or Local 
    
    Municipal Corporations and Village Grampanchayats to assist in an animal rescue. We have been deployed for various kinds of technical animal rescues
    
    and disaster response across Pune District and in several parts of Maharashtra. 
        
<b>2.The Team</b>
    
    Our team consists of individuals who are trained professionals in search and rescue operations equipped with the knowledge, skill and gear required for

    animal handling, safe retrieval and post-rescue management. We have members on our team who have combined their passion for rescuing animals with 
     
    their extensive experience in rock climbing and rappelling as well as veterinarians and species-specific animal rescuers whose expertise in animal handling

    and behaviour which are key to a successful technical rescue operation.

       <b style="font-size: 30px;">                                NO ANIMAL DESERVES TO BE TREATED POORLY</b>
      
    How would you feel if someone you loved was abused or mistreated? It’s happening every day, all around the world, to billions (yes, with a ‘b’) of animals.

    We have the capacity to stop much of it, but only if people step up and find ways to prevent animal cruelty.Some animals are starved because their owners 

    can’t pay for their food. Others receive no meals as a punishment or because the owner wants them to remain docile.Starving an animal causes serious harm  

    in both the short- and long-term. Malnourishment, hunger pangs, inability to defend, dehydration, and vulnerability to illness are just a few of the 

    potential ramifications.
