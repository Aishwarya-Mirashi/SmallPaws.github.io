    font-size:22px;">
    For 20 years, Small Paws has worked to help people and nature thrive.

    At every level, we collaborate with people in Maharashtra to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities,animals, 
    
    and the places in which they live. Founded in 2001, the Small Paws is the only open access, no-kill animal welfare organization 
    
    operating in Maharashtra. With 3,000 animals being rehomed annually through aggressive adoption programs and other services, Small 
    
    Paws has joined leading shelters around the state as a model organization for lifesaving culture change in its community. Small 
    
    Paws accepts all animals regardless of health, age, temperament or breed. Over the years more than 3500 animals have received 
    
    care through Small Paws' programs and services. As a result of our commitment to excellence and fiscal responsibility, Small 
    
    Paws has earned a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for the fourth consecutive year, and five out of the last ten years! 
    
    By sponsoring a Small Paws program, attending our events, or contributing through our direct mail campaigns or publications,
    
    you continue to help us provide quality medical care, food and shelter, adoption and spay neuter programs, humane education 
    
    and other important services for the animals and community. Thanks to the generous support of people like you, we are able 
    
    to expand and grow these vital services. Our staff and volunteers encourage compassion for all life on our planet.
