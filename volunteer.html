     Come visit us and meet SMALL PAWS animals or volunteer. Animals at Small Paws are always happy to have visitors! 
     
     We appreciate all the help we can get from like-minded people who want to work with us. 
        
     Which is why we have carefully curated a programme which has multiple options for everyone who wants to give 
     
     their time for this cause. Volunteers and visitors are welcome at Small Paws on prior appointment only.
        
     Thank you for your interest in volunteering with Small Paws! 

     Most volunteers donâ€™t need any previous experience, but we do have commitment requirements to ensure the 
     
     best care for our animals and the safety of our teams.
